# Scribble
A simple drawing app using swift

- The app has a canvas on which a user can scribble.
- The app has tools like brush to draw and an eraser to erase.
- The user can press reset to clear everything on the canvas.
- Settings page to adjust the size of brush, opacity and pick a stroke color.

Future Enhancements:
- Undo and Redo functionality by keeping track of drawing context in a stack.
- Saving the work done on canvas and being able to restore the same context to edit.
- Separating the Drawing logic from viewController class instead of the current Massive View Controller.
- Test cases: UITests, Unit Tests, logic tests and Code coverage.
